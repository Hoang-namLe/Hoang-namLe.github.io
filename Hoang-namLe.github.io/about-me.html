		<p>I was born April 3rd, 2004 in San Jose California.  I went to Terrell Elementary School, John Muir Middle School, and am currently going to Gunderson High school.  I like to listen to music and watch Netflix or youtube in my spare time.  I play Badminton and am planning on doing Water Polo next year.</p>
		<p>I am a Vietnamese American, and a quarter chinese.  I am 5'3, 15 years old, and have dark brown eyes.  I go to a summer program at Stanford called SMASH where I live on campus and take classes.  I really like it because I get to chill with a lot of people that I normally wouldn't get to, and they are also all extremely friendly and kind!</p>
